Welcome to the Robot Receptionist project repository! This project aims to develop a robot receptionist system for Aston University, capable of guiding guests around the campus using advanced robotics and software technologies.

## Project Overview

The scope of the project involves the development and deployment of a software system on a robotic platform (RB1 BASE) and an embedded computing board (Nvidia Jetson Orin). The system will be capable of executing commands over voice and integrating with ROS1 topics for navigation.

## Features

- Voice-activated robot movement via ROS2
- Integration with ROS1 topics for mapping, localization, and laser sensing
- Real-time visualization of robot data using RVIZ
- Speech-to-text conversion for voice commands
- Integration of additional ROS topics and features as extra enhancements

## Usage

These files are exclusively working with the RB1 base and Jetson Orin present at University, but could be tweaked to work for any device, system or robot.
